This guide will get you up and running with the SecureLend SDK.

## Installation

First, install the SDK using your favorite package manager.

```bash
npm install @securelend/sdk
```

## Example: Get Loan Offers

Here's a runnable example to fetch loan offers. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual key.

```javascript
import { SecureLend } from '@securelend/sdk';

const client = new SecureLend({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
});

async function getOffers() {
  try {
    const offers = await client.getLoanOffers({
      amount: 50000,
      term: 12, // in months
      businessType: 'SaaS',
    });
    console.log('Successfully fetched offers:', offers);
    return offers;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch offers:', error);
  }
}

getOffers();
```

## Expected Output

If successful, you will see a list of loan offers logged to your console.

```json
Successfully fetched offers: [
  {
    "lender": "Lender A",
    "amount": 50000,
    "interestRate": 0.05,
    "term": 12
  },
  {
    "lender": "Lender B",
    "amount": 50000,
    "interestRate": 0.055,
    "term": 12
  }
]
```
