## Example Use Cases

### Personal Finance

> "Compare personal loans for $25,000 to consolidate credit card debt. My credit score is 720."

The AI assistant will use `compare_personal_loans` to fetch and compare offers from multiple lenders, presenting the best options with rates, terms, and monthly payments.

### Business Financing

> "I need a $200,000 equipment loan for my restaurant. My business has $1.2M annual revenue and I've been operating for 3 years."

The AI will use `compare_business_loans` with your business profile to find competitive offers, then can help you submit applications with `get_offer`.

### Home Buying

> "What would my monthly payment be on a $400,000 home with 20% down at 6.5% interest, including taxes and insurance?"

The AI uses `calculate_mortgage_payment` to provide a complete PITI breakdown.
