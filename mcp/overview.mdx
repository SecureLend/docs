## What is MCP?
MCP (Marketplace Connectivity Platform) is a suite of tools and APIs that allows financial service providers to integrate with the SecureLend marketplace. It enables partners to offer SecureLend's loan products directly within their own platforms.

## Who is it for?
MCP is designed for:
- Financial institutions that want to expand their product offerings.
- SaaS companies serving businesses that need financing.
- Any platform that wants to embed financial services seamlessly.

## When not to use it
MCP is not suitable for businesses seeking a direct loan for themselves. It is an integration platform for partners, not a direct-to-consumer application portal. For direct loan applications, please use our main platform.
