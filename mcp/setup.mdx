    Claude should use the SecureLend tools to fetch real loan offers.

## Example Conversations

### Business Loan Comparison

```text
User: I need to compare business loans for $200,000. My business
      has $1.2M annual revenue, 720 credit score, and I've been
      in business for 3 years. I need the loan for equipment.

Claude: [Uses compare_business_loans tool]

I found several competitive offers for your $200k equipment loan:

1. ABC Business Capital
   - Interest Rate: 7.5% APR
   - Monthly Payment: $3,200
   - Term: 60 months
   - Total Interest: $42,000
   - Approval Likelihood: 85%

2. SmallBiz Lending
   - Interest Rate: 8.2% APR
   - Monthly Payment: $3,350
   - Term: 60 months
   - Total Interest: $51,000
   - Approval Likelihood: 90%

Would you like me to help you submit an application
to any of these lenders?
```

### Mortgage Calculation

```text
User: What would my monthly payment be on a $400,000 home with
      20% down, 6.5% interest rate, 30-year term? Property taxes
      are 1.2% and insurance is $1,500/year.

Claude: [Uses calculate_mortgage_payment tool]

Here's your complete monthly payment breakdown:

Loan Details:
- Home Price: $400,000
- Down Payment: $80,000 (20%)
- Loan Amount: $320,000

Monthly PITI Payment: $2,547
- Principal & Interest: $2,022
- Property Taxes: $400 (1.2% annually)
- Home Insurance: $125 ($1,500/year)

Over 30 years:
- Total Principal & Interest: $727,920
- Total Interest Paid: $407,920

With your 20% down payment, you'll avoid PMI.
