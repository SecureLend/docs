## Claude Desktop

Connect SecureLend to Claude Desktop in under 2 minutes.

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed (available for Mac, Windows, Linux)
- Text editor to edit configuration file
- Internet connection

### Step 1: Locate Configuration File

Find your Claude Desktop configuration file based on your operating system:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    ```bash
    ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```

    **Quick Access:**
    ```bash
    # Open in default editor
    open ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

    # Or navigate in Finder
    open ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/
    ```

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```bash
    %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
    ```

    **Quick Access:**
    1. Press `Win + R`
    2. Type: `%APPDATA%\Claude`
    3. Press Enter
    4. Open `claude_desktop_config.json` in Notepad

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Linux">
    ```bash
    ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```

    **Quick Access:**
    ```bash
    # Open in default editor
    xdg-open ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

    # Or with nano
    nano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Add SecureLend Server

Open the configuration file and add SecureLend to the `mcpServers` section:

<CodeGroup>
```json New Configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "securelend": {
      "url": "https://mcp.securelend.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

```json Existing MCP Servers
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "securelend": {
      "url": "https://mcp.securelend.ai/mcp"
    },
    "other-server": {
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Ensure your JSON syntax is valid. Missing commas or brackets will prevent
  Claude Desktop from starting.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

1. **Quit Claude Desktop completely**
   - macOS: `Cmd + Q` or Quit from menu bar
   - Windows: Right-click system tray icon → Exit
   - Linux: Close all windows and background processes

2. **Reopen Claude Desktop**

3. **Wait for MCP servers to connect** (usually 2-3 seconds)

### Step 4: Verify Connection

Open a new conversation in Claude Desktop and try:

<CodeGroup>
```text Business Loans
Compare business loans for $200,000 for equipment. 
My business has $1.2M annual revenue and a 720 credit score.
```

```text Personal Loans
Compare personal loans for $25,000 for debt consolidation
with a credit score of 720.
```

```text Mortgage Calculator
What would my monthly payment be on a $400,000 home with
20% down at 6.5% interest over 30 years?
```

</CodeGroup>

If working correctly, Claude will use the SecureLend tools and return loan offers or calculations.

<Check>
  **Success!** You should see Claude using the `compare_business_loans`,
  `compare_personal_loans`, or `calculate_mortgage_payment` tools.
</Check>

### Mortgage Calculation

```text

Claude: [Uses calculate_mortgage_payment tool]
