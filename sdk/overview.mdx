title: SDK Overview
---

The SecureLend SDK provides a convenient way to interact with the SecureLend API from your application.

## What is the SDK for?
Use the SDK to programmatically:
- Fetch and compare business loan offers.
- Manage loan applications.
- Handle authentication seamlessly.

## When to use the SDK vs. API
- **Use the SDK** for most backend integrations. It handles authentication, retries, and data typing for you, accelerating development.
- **Use the API directly** for unsupported languages, custom authentication flows, or when you need fine-grained control over network requests.

## GitHub Repository
The official SDK repository can be found on GitHub:
