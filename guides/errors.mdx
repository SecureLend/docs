title: Error Handling
---

Our API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Errors will be returned with a JSON body containing more details.

## Error Format

```json
{
  "code": "INVALID_INPUT",
  "message": "amount must be greater than 0"
}
```

## Common Errors

  </Card>

## Retry vs. No-Retry
- **Retry**: Network errors or `5xx` server errors can generally be retried. We recommend an exponential backoff strategy.
- **Do Not Retry**: `4xx` client errors (like `INVALID_INPUT` or `UNAUTHORIZED`) should not be retried without first correcting the underlying issue in your request.
